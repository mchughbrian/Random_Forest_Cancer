# Random Forest Cancer

# Purpose 
Gain experience with feature selection and the random forest machine learning algorithm. 

# Methods 
The problem we are trying to solve is predicting melignant or benign diagnosis from 30 attritubutes taken from a diagnostic imaging test. 
As I am not familiar with the 30 attribute exploratory data analysis helped compare which attributes varied the most between the melignant and benign diagnosis. 
Created the model on selected features with SKlearn Random Forest. 

# Results 

Type 2 error - 4 (False Negative) 
Type 1 error - 2 (False Positive)

Accuracy - ~96%

# Learnings 

Diving into a problem with little background knowledge of attributes. Cutting down a high number of attributes to simplify model and save on computational time. 
Learning about random forest algorithm: Builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction. Random forests are random in the sense that they search for the best features among random subset of features which results in a better model. The random forest is able to be used in both classification and regression problems.
